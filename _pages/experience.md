Jan 2020 - Feb 2020
* Trained Parallel CRNN, CRNN and LSTM models to identify 182 different Brazilian bird genera.
* All models trained separately on mel-spectrograms representations of a subset of high quality audio recordings of Brazilian birds' songs obtained from https://www.xeno-canto.org/ using their API.

### [Election Forecast](https://github.com/Vignesh-Nswamy/Data-Science/tree/master/Project%202)
* Led a team of 2 undergraduates to build a regression model to predict number of votes that may be cast for a political party in each U.S. county using demographics information of 2018 U.S. Senate elections.
* Trained a classification model to categorize counties based on votes cast for each political party.
