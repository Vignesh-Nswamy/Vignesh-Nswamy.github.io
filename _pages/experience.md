## Mariner
### Data Science Intern
*Charlotte, North Carolina, United States* <br />
Jan 2021 - Present
* Deployed a PixelLink-like deep learning model on Azure to detect text in engineering drawings.
* Working on GenICam Python SDK to detect and control GigE Vision cameras.

## University of Illinois at Chicago
### Grad Student Researcher
*Chicago, Illinois, United States* <br />
Mar 2020 - Dec 2020
* Used OpenCV to synchronize multi-perspective videos by tracking a moving object in the video streams.
* Trained Time Contrastive Networks on unlabeled multi-perspective videos to learn viewpoint-invariant representations, which were later used to aid a robot (UR10e) to imitate tasks performed by a human demonstrator.

## Mariner
### Data Science Intern
*Charlotte, North Carolina, United States* <br />
Jun 2020 - Aug 2020
* Annotated engineering drawings using CVAT tool and prepared datasets to train text detection and segmentation models.
* Utilized OpenCV and PixelLink-like text detection model from OpenVino respectively to detect objects and text in engineering drawings.
* Fine-tuned U-Net and DeepLab segmentation models and used them along with Azure OCR for localized information extraction from engineering drawings.

## Zoho Corporation
### Member Technical Staff - Software Engineer
*Chennai, India* <br />
May 2017 - Jun 2019
* Designed and deployed a framework to track user activities assisting project management teams streamline feature releases.
* Enhanced Zoho Creator’s API infrastructure by rewriting them using updated internal frameworks for data retrieval and caching resulting in reduction of performance bottlenecks by up to 75%.
* Developed Command Line tools to download user data from Zoho Creator, tested to be 45% faster than previous versions.
* Built tools using Bash and Python to automate DevOps processes saving developers up to 20 minutes every day.
* Facilitated planning and review discussions with customer support teams and project leads to establish project goals and timelines.
* Collaborated with customer support teams to resolve software-specific functionality issues in Zoho Creator platform.

## Zoho Corporation
### Project Trainee - Intern
*Chennai, India* <br />
Dec 2016 - May 2017
* Developed a JSON Stream parsing tool for Zoho Creator to obtain statistics on usage of API and Web URLs.

## Projects
### [Incorporating BERT into Abstractive Text Summarization](https://github.com/Vignesh-Nswamy/Abstractive-Text-Summarization)
Nov 2020 - Dec 2020
* Led a team of graduate students in building and training a custom Transformer architecture with a pre-trained BERT encoder backbone on CNN Dailymail dataset to summarize news articles.

### [3D Deep Learning architectures to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease](https://github.com/Vignesh-Nswamy/AD-Diagnosis)
Apr 2020 - May 2020
* Headed a team of two graduate students in designing Deep 3D Convolutional Networks to diagnose Alzheimer’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment using 3-D neuroimages and patient demographics.

### [Image Generation using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/Vignesh-Nswamy/DCGAN)
Feb 2020 - Mar 2020
* Developed a DCGAN to recognize complex patterns in images from CelebFaces Attributes Dataset and generate real-looking fake facial images.

### [Emotion Detection using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/Vignesh-Nswamy/Emotion-Detection)
Feb 2020 - Mar 2020
* Built a DCNN to identify a subject's emotional state (Anger, Disgust, Fear, happiness, sadness, surprise or neutrality) from facial image.
* Model trained on facial image dataset available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data)

### [Identification of Bird Genus using Parallel CRNN and CRNN](https://github.com/Vignesh-Nswamy/Bird-Genus-Identification)
Jan 2020 - Feb 2020
* Trained Parallel CRNN, CRNN and LSTM models to identify 182 different Brazilian bird genera.
* All models trained separately on mel-spectrograms representations of a subset of high quality audio recordings of Brazilian birds' songs obtained from https://www.xeno-canto.org/ using their API.

### [Election Forecast](https://github.com/Vignesh-Nswamy/Data-Science/tree/master/Project%202)
* Led a team of 2 undergraduates to build a regression model to predict number of votes that may be cast for a political party in each U.S. county using demographics information of 2018 U.S. Senate elections.
* Trained a classification model to categorize counties based on votes cast for each political party.
