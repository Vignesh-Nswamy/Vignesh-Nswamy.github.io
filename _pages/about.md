Hey there!

I am Vignesh Narayanaswamy, a graduate student at University of Illinois at Chicago majoring in Computer Science with concentration in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am currently a Data Science Intern at Mariner where I am responsible for curating a custom image dataset and training deep learning models for object detection.
My previous research experiences in the field include my masterâ€™s project which revolves around robotic imitation learning and my summer internship where I worked on a Machine Learning pipeline to extract information from engineering drawings. Apart from that I have worked on several academic and personal projects that have helped me garner knowledge in the domain.
When I am not coding, I enjoy reading historical thrillers and novels based on Greek mythology. I am also an avid gamer and photographer.
